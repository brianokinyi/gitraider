# **GitRaider**  
_A tool to mass hunt exposed `.git` directories on websites._

## **Overview**
GitRaider is a powerful and automated tool written in Go, designed to identify exposed `.git` directories on web servers. 
Exposing `.git` directories can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including source code, credentials, and 
configuration files. GitRaider helps developers, penetration testers, and security professionals identify and remediate such risks effectively.

## **Features**
- Fast and efficient scanning powered by Goâ€™s concurrency model.
- Automated detection of exposed `.git` directories.
- Output results in a structured format (JSON, CSV, etc.).
- Supports bulk domain input via files.
- Simple CLI interface.

## **Use Cases**
1. **Penetration Testing:** Quickly locate vulnerable `.git` directories during security assessments.
2. **Bug Bounty Hunting:** Identify and report exposed `.git` directories to bug bounty programs.
3. **Self-Auditing:** Scan your own assets to ensure `.git` directories are not publicly accessible.
